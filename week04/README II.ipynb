      "source": "For this assignment I chose to break the locations up by Ivy League schools. I dug into some data on what regions were had the most snow and saw the North East was the most consistent. Knowing that, I decided to use Ivy Leagues since they're in the North East.\n\nTo go with this, I also included data on the sunlight in the cities. No Sun means that it'll be colder longer and that there will be more clouds.\n\nWith that, I sat this dataframe up to where it will only find specific schools and not use their subsideraries. Doing this reduces the number of states that have to be used in this project. On top of that, I created a join that linked the schools with the weather data by using locational data. The reason why is due to the fact that that was the only thing that was consistent across the data frames. If you look in the drafts folders you will see who I messed up in one of my earlier attempts. \n\nIntially I had each university numbered and I planned to use that to connect it to the location and weather data. The issue with that is there wasn't an easy way to connect the two. So to fix this issue the lat/long data had to act as a base. \n\nOnce I had the school data matched up, I realized that I was pulling back days individually instead of merging them all together to where it only showed individual school and the count of the sunlight and below freezing weather. To fix this I had to do a bit of research and try a varity of techniques. Luckily I had some support online.  \nAdditional tools I used to help: https://www.latlong.net/\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/snowfalls-totals-list-winter-storm-2026/\n\nhttps://www.gps-coordinates.net/",
