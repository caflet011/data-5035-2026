I dug into some data on what regions were had the most snow and saw the North East was the most consistent. Knowing that, I decided to use Ivy Leagues since they're in the North East.\n\nTo go with this, I also included data on the sunlight in the cities. No Sun means that it'll be colder longer and that there will be more clouds.",
