      "source": "Data Engineering Assignment 1 \nThree Insights\nCarl Fletcher \nFor this first assignment, I spoke with Claude, the AI bot from Antropic. With this conversation, I had it pretend to be someone named “Bob Ross” which is essentially me but after I take this course. Learning from it was very insightful. \n\nThe first insight I gained from it was the fact that data has various applications to customer facing products, and with that you need to consider what your current application architecture is before proceeding forward. Constraints can come up at any time, but a good understanding of engineering processes can help you know ahead of time. \n\nThe next insight I wanted to share from speaking with Claude (aka Bob Ross) was that this class will be heavy on technical items and that will equip me with an advantage in my career due to the lack of technicality a lot of people have in the Product space. For the later weeks (7-12), there is a lot of information I will be learning that will directly impact my job but also prepare me to do better when I move on to the next phase of my career. \n\nThe final insight I wanted to share is the value of proper data ingestion and flow. When I spoke to Claude he mentioned something very important, it mentioned the phrases “greenfield” and “brownfield”. I’ll paste Claude’s commentary on what it means below: \nGreenfield = Building something brand new from scratch, like building on an empty field. No existing systems to work around.\nBrownfield = Working with existing systems that are already running. You've got legacy code, existing databases, users depending on it, technical debt - the whole nine yards.\nI’ve never heard of this term before but depending on which of these two positions your application is at it’ll help direct where you focus your data applications. In this class, I will be learning a lot about data infrastructure. From the way databases flow together with the application to how to build them further in preparation for new software to be built upon an existing application. With that knowledge, I can be flexible with my planning for different types of applications. Whether my application is brand new and “greenfield” or old and “brownfield” I can plan and adjust using the knowledge I have in this class. I picked that up after Claude explained the meaning of these terms, and how it ties into the course. \n",
