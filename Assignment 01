==================================================
GENERAL TIPS TO DO WELL IN CLASS
==================================================
1. Treat every assignment as a mini production system
2. Document decisions, not just code
3. Take data profiling seriously
4. Prioritize clarity over cleverness
5. Be consistent with tools and pipeline structure
6. Start midterm and final projects early
7. Practice explaining your work out loud
8. Use GitHub as a communication and narrative tool
9. Maximize participation points
10. Remember: Raw data is evidence, not truth
